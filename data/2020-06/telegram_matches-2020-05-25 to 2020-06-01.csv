Through Christian principles, we aim to offer an education that transforms lives and communities. Everyone in our academy community deserves to be cared for unconditionally and valued equally as a unique creation, made in the image of God.

Do those Christian principles include teaching eleven year old kids about pornography?

Not sure Jesus taught kids about pornography?

Looks like Church of England schools like to sexualise children. 🤔

I wonder what Jesus would think of that?

While I don’t condone these types of acts the Daily Sabah have missed out half of the story behind Turkish controlled DITIB mosques. 

At the beginning of 2018, the German Government decided it would no longer fund the DITIB, and with good reason. Sevim Dagdelen, the deputy parliamentary head of the Left Party, called for federal states to cut all ties with DITIB and for the group’s charity tax status to be re-examined.

“The Federal Government and the federal states must stop cooperation at all levels with Erdogan’s outpost in Germany. It must be examined whether the preferential tax treatment of the association can be further justified. DITIB is not charitable, but a danger to the public”

Eye witness accounts by Pervez Masih, Younas Masih, and Naeem Masih state that Myra was forcibly abducted in a car while she resisted. The men were armed and as such the eyewitnesses could not help the victim. The accused also fired shots in the air. 

Speaking to International Christian Concern, her mother, Nighat, expressed fears of rape, forceful conversion to Islam, and even murder. She was indeed married off to her abductor and forcibly converted.

Arjan Kikija has been jailed for more than two years after he was caught with fake documents and weapon.

He also produced a driving licence and ID card. The documents claimed Kikija was a man from Italy and was entitled to live in the UK.

He’s actually an Albanian who has been deported once before. He went to some trouble and expense to get back here illegally.

Kikija was jailed for 28 months and likely faces deportation after his sentence.

Likely? He’s here illegally and he’s got criminal convictions. There shouldn’t be anything “likely” about it. He should be booted out of the UK at his own expense. If he can afford to buy fake documents and deal drugs he can afford a one way plane trip home.

Last month, data from Sweden’s Public Health Agency confirmed that Somali Swedes made up almost 5 percent of the country’s COVID-19 cases, yet represented less than 1 percent of its 10 million people.

With Sweden’s relatively low-key approach to fighting the virus that relies mainly on voluntary social distancing, there are concerns the message has not reached everyone in immigrant neighborhoods.
“It’s important that everyone living here who has a different mother tongue gets the right information,” said Warda Addallah, a 17-year-old Somali Swede.

If immigration rules mandated speaking the language of the host country then perhaps this wouldn’t be so much of a problem?

He admitted encouraging acts of terror and inciting religious hatred via social media.

His lawyers are arguing that the Terrorist Offenders (Restriction of Early Release) Act, which only became law in February, discriminates against Muslims.

The new rules, which require those convicted of terror offences to spend two-thirds of their term in jail before being considered for release, are directed against those holding “particular Islamic beliefs” and have a “disproportionate impact” on Muslims, the court was told.

So his human rights are more important than the human rights of non Muslims who he hates?

Our judicial system is a joke!

In June 2014, Bala’s family forcefully confined him to a psychiatric hospital in Kano for renouncing Islam, according to reports by the BBC. He was released 18 days later from the Kano Psychiatric Hospital. 

Bala said that he was “drugged by force” with medicines meant for “psychotic and schizophrenic patients.”

Sir John Hayes urged the government to look more towards building up local communities within Britain and argued that a reliance on gloabalisation “which benefits the liberal elite” has failed the country.
